An SSH key consists of two components: a public key and a private key. These keys are generated using cryptographic algorithms, and they work together as a pair. The public key is meant to be shared with others, while the private key must be kept secret and protected. Therefore, the private key remains securely stored on the developer's local machine & the public key can be safely shared with GitHub.
