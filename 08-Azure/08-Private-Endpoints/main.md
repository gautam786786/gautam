Azure Private Endpoint:

Definition: Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure over a Private Link. It uses a private IP address from your virtual network, eliminating exposure to the public internet.
How it Works: When you create a private endpoint for a specific service, it provisions a private IP address within your virtual network. This IP address is then mapped to the service. Applications within the virtual network can use this private IP address to connect to the service, and traffic stays within the Microsoft Azure backbone network.
Azure Private Link Service:

Definition: Azure Private Link Service is the service-side of Private Link. It enables you to expose your services privately to your own virtual network or to other trusted networks. It allows customers to access services over a private connection.
How it Works: When you enable Private Link Service for your own service, Azure creates a private endpoint on the consumer's side. This private endpoint has a private IP address in the consumer's virtual network, and it can be used to access the service securely. This way, the service is not directly exposed to the internet, and the traffic remains within the Azure backbone.
Benefits of Azure Private Endpoint and Azure Private Link Service:

Security: Services are accessed over the Microsoft Azure backbone, reducing exposure to the public internet and potential security risks.
Isolation: Private connectivity ensures that data flows directly between the consumer and the service without going over the internet, providing isolation from public network traffic.
Compliance: Helps meet regulatory and compliance requirements by keeping sensitive data within a private network.
It's important to check the Azure documentation for the latest updates and any changes or additional features introduced after January 2022, as Microsoft regularly updates its services.
