# File Provisioner: The file provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created resource. The file provisioner supports both ssh and winrm type connections.
# local-exec Provisioner: The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource.
# remote-exec Provisioner: The remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc.
