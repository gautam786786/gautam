How to Tag Docker Images

docker image build --tag custom-nginx:packaged .

In cases where you forgot to tag an image during build time, or maybe you want to change the tag, you can use the image tag command to do that:

docker image tag <image id> <image repository>:<image tag>

## or ##

docker image tag <image repository>:<image tag> <new image repository>:<new image tag>
